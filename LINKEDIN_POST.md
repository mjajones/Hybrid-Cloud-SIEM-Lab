## Option 1: Technical Focus

🚀 **Just completed my Hybrid Cloud SIEM Lab project!** 

I built an enterprise-grade security infrastructure that bridges AWS cloud with on-premise systems using Wazuh SIEM, demonstrating real-world security operations capabilities.

**What I accomplished:**
✅ Deployed Wazuh SIEM monitoring hybrid cloud infrastructure
✅ Configured Windows Active Directory with Group Policy Objects
✅ Implemented network segmentation with OPNsense firewall & IDS/IPS
✅ Established secure cloud connectivity via Tailscale VPN
✅ Simulated and detected real-world attacks (brute force, network scans)

**Key challenges I overcame:**
🔧 Recovered SIEM from critical disk failure (98% capacity crash)
🔧 Resolved log ingestion issues between AWS Ubuntu and on-premise SIEM
🔧 Created custom detection rules for reverse shell attacks

This project showcases hands-on experience with SIEM management, hybrid cloud security, network segmentation, and incident response—skills directly applicable to SOC analyst and security engineer roles.

## Option 2: Story-Driven Approach

📊 **From 98% disk failure to fully operational SIEM in 24 hours**

I just completed a comprehensive Hybrid Cloud SIEM lab that taught me more about disaster recovery and troubleshooting than any certification could.

**The journey:**
1. Built Windows Active Directory domain with GPOs
2. Deployed OPNsense firewall with IDS/IPS
3. Set up Wazuh SIEM connecting AWS EC2 to on-premise infrastructure
4. Hit a critical failure: disk filled to 98%, crashed the database
5. Recovered the system, learned log rotation, and implemented proper capacity planning

**What I learned:**
- How to recover a Linux database service from "Disk Full" crash
- The difference between journald and syslog (critical for cloud deployments)
- Real-time threat detection and custom rule creation
- Hybrid cloud networking with zero-trust VPN

The best part? I documented every challenge, solution, and screenshot—turning problems into portfolio gold.

## Option 3: Skills-Focused

🎯 **Building the skills that get you hired in cybersecurity**

Just wrapped up a 6-phase Hybrid Cloud SIEM project covering everything from Active Directory to cloud security monitoring.

**Skills demonstrated:**
🔐 SIEM Management (Wazuh)
☁️ Hybrid Cloud Security (AWS + On-Premise)
🛡️ Network Segmentation (OPNsense, VLANs, DMZ)
👥 Active Directory & Group Policy
🔍 Threat Detection & Incident Response
🛠️ Disaster Recovery & Troubleshooting

**Real-world scenarios:**
- Recovered SIEM from critical disk failure
- Resolved log incompatibility between cloud and on-premise systems
- Detected brute force attacks and network reconnaissance
- Created custom detection rules for advanced threats

This isn't just a lab—it's a portfolio piece that shows I can handle production security infrastructure.
